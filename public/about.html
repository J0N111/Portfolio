I have always strayed towards art forms that are more hands-on in nature, but I have been actively pushing myself towards digital art for the last four years. With my introduction to the world of digital art came my love for pixelated artworks in the form of animated digital wallpapers. It is from this love that I started to watch tutorials and how-to videos in earnest. My goal in art is to not only lose myself in the art forms I love, but to branch out and find more art forms to explore. asddasdads </p>
		  
	    <p>Education wise, I started college with the intention to go into mechanical engineering with a focus in robotics or mechatronics. My affinity for hands-on projects is what initially lead me to pursue engineering, but I became more and more certain that mech-e did not fit with what I was looking for out of a future career. It was during the first months of Corona that I was able to finally sit down and ask myself what I wanted to do and what major mould allow me to do it. I realized that the two parts of mech-e that I truely loved were our hands-on building and CADing projects. After a long debate with myself, I decided to focus on pursuing a major that would allow me to CAD my heart out. Although I'm not physically touching the items I create while CADing, the joy I feel as I pour everything I have into my CADing is just as great!</p></div>
