    <p> My inspiration for this project were the other pixel art gifs that I used as my phone’s wallpaper for years as well as the looping animation that plays on the lofi study music video on YouTube. To make the room, I first brainstormed how I would want my room to look like in a normal yet futuristic world. I made a rough sketch that featured a L-desk, Christmas lights, blowing leaves, rain and a view of a bustling city below. </p>
    <p> The hardest part of this project was getting everything right initially. I decided that using an isometric view of the room would make the composition more interesting visually, so I shifted the sketch to match my vision better. Surprisingly, the base image was not hard to make, just extremely time consuming – more so than what I initially thought it would be. When I nearly reached the end of the base image stage I decided that having an entire city would be too large a scope, so I settled for two buildings and a howling lightning storm. </p>
    <p> This gif remains one of my all time favorite works and my only regret is that I no longer have the psd file for it. If I were to redo it, I would change the overall purple hue I gave the room to something darker but less washed out. I would also make the light of the lightning and the Christmas lights stand out more by lighting up more objects around where the light touches. I really love the flashing Christmas lights, but I think adding light on the string itself and the glass behind it would help give the lights more believability. </p>
